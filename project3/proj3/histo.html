            <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            While the Internet has been around in some form since the 60’s or 80’s
             , the concept of the Web came into being in 1989 
             when <b> Berners-Lee</b> and <b>Robert Cailliau</b> wrote a proposal about the WorldWideWeb 
             for their employer, the research organization, <b>CERN</b>.<sup><a href="references.html#r1">{1}</a></sup> In this article, we will dive into the history,evolution,trends and future of the web.

            <h2>Milestones and evolution</h2>

            <p><ul>
<li><strong>In 1990</strong>: World’s first website and server go live at CERN, running on Tim Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer, which has the message “This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER DOWN!” <sup><a href="references.html#r2">{2}</a></sup></li>

            </figure>

<li><strong>In 1991</strong>: The World Wide Web becomes publicly available on the Internet.</li>
<li><strong>In 1993</strong>: The Mosaic web browser is released. It is the first browser to display images inline with text, rather than in a separate window.</li>
<li><strong>In 1994</strong>: Netscape Communications is founded by Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark. They release the Netscape Navigator browser.</li>
<li><strong>In 1995</strong>: Microsoft releases Internet Explorer. This leads to the "browser wars" between Netscape and Microsoft.</li>
<li><strong>In 1998</strong>: Google is founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. While not a browser, Google's search engine quickly becomes the most popular way to search the web..</li>
<li><strong>In 2004</strong>: Mozilla Firefox is released as an open-source alternative to Internet Explorer and Netscape.</li>
<li><strong>In 2008</strong>: Google releases the Chrome browser.</li>
<li><strong>In 2015</strong>: Microsoft releases Edge to replace Internet Explorer.</li>
<li><strong>In 2022</strong>: The World Wide Web turns 33 years old, having transformed from a simple text-based system to a complex, multimedia-rich platform that is integral to modern life.</li>

            <h2>Browser Trends & Future</h2>
            <p>
                According to W3Schools statistics, <b>Google Chrome </b>has dominated the browser market for 
                several years, with over 80% of users choosing it as their primary browser in 2025.
                 <b>Firefox</b> and <b>Microsoft Edge</b> follow, but with much smaller shares. Internet Explorer 
                 usage has dropped to nearly zero, reflecting the shift towards modern, faster, and
                  more secure browsers. This trend highlights the importance of web standards and 
                  performance, as users prefer browsers 
                that offer speed, security, and compatibility with the latest web technologies.<sup><a href="references.html#r3">{3}</a></sup>

    <h2>The Future of the Web</h2>
    <p>
The internet has changed from being a static, one-use technology to becoming a vital, immersive, and dynamic 
aspect of daily life. It now drives sophisticated applications, social media, and even professional software, 
after formerly being dominated by basic utilities and browsing. As 
technology develops, the web becomes increasingly powerful, accessible, and decentralized.
</p>
<p> 
The next significant development of the internet is <strong>Web 4.0</strong>, sometimes referred to as the
 Intelligent or Symbiotic Web, which combines cutting-edge machine learning, artificial intelligence,
  and decentralized technology. It provides highly customized and secure user experiences by facilitating
   smooth interaction between the digital and real worlds. With attributes 
including improved privacy via decentralization, user-centered design, and real-time connectivity.
 According to Kacper Rafalski, Web 4.0 is set to transform sectors such as healthcare, transportation,
and social networking.<sup><a href="references.html#r4">{4}</a></sup>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The history of the web and browsers reflects a remarkable journey from simple, static pages to a dynamic, 
        intelligent, and interconnected digital world. As browsers and web technologies continue to evolve, they 
        shape how we communicate, work, and access information every day. Looking ahead, innovations like Web 4.0
         promise even greater integration of artificial intelligence, personalization, and decentralization, 
         ensuring the web remains a vital and transformative force in our lives.
