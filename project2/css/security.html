            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Although the Internet facilitates communication and enjoyment, there are security hazards 
                associated with it. You can greatly lower your risk of becoming a victim of cybercrimes by being 
                aware of such hazards and learning safe practices.The common threats on the internet are covered 
                in this article, along with the several precautions that can be done to keep users safe.

            <h2>Common Threats</h2>
            <p>Some of the common threats to web security are:</p>
            <ol>
        <li><strong>Phishing</strong>: According to cloudflare, it is a method to steal sensitive information, such as
                     usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, or other personal 
                     data in order to utilize or sell the stolen information. The attacker typically 
                     impersonates a trusted source and presents an appealing request to deceive the victim, 
                     similar to how a fisherman uses bait to lure a fish.<sup><a href="references.html#r5">{5}</a></sup></li>

        <li><strong>Malware</strong>: It is malicious software (viruses, spyware, Trojans, etc.) that can infect your device, often delivered through infected files or websites.</li>
               
        <li><strong>Data breaches</strong>:A data breach occurs when unauthorized parties access 
            sensitive or confidential information such as personal details, financial records, 
            or login credentials. These incidents often result from
            cyberattacks, phishing schemes, or poor security practices 
            and can have serious consequences, such as identity theft and financial loss.</li>
           
        <li> <strong>Public Wi-fi risks</strong> :This risk comes from using unsecured 
            networks in places like cafes and airports, where lack of encryption makes it easy for
            cybercriminals to intercept data. Hackers can use methods like<b> Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)</b> attacks to steal sensitive 
            information or infect devices with malware.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            According to SentinelOne, the frequency of cyberattacks has doubled since 
            the COVID-19 pandemic, as per IMF(International Monetary Fund). 
            Studies from the IMF report that cybercrime will cost the world $23 
            trillion in 2027, an increase of 175% from 2022.<sup><a href="references.html#r6">{6}</a></sup>

            <h2>Security Measures</h2>
            <p>To avoid these threats, users and organizations can implement various security measures:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use strong passwords.</li>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication.</li>
                <li>Keep software and systems updated.</li>
                <li>Use a vpn (when using public Wi-Fi).</li>
                <li>Be cautious with links and Emails.</li>
                <li>Back up data in case of data loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Most importantly, being aware of the cyberattacks is the best way to avoid them.
                Staying up to date with the latest risks and how they work is crucial to becoming able
                 to recognize and avoid any online threats.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            The <b> National Academy of Sciences </b>states: "Cybersecurity is a never-ending battle. 
            A permanently decisive solution to the problem will not be found in the foreseeable future."<sup><a href="references.html#r7">{7}</a></sup> 
      <br> However, we can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to cyberattacks by being aware of common threats
           and taking precautions.
           Being informed is essential in this constantly changing web security industry.
