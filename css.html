        <h2>History of CSS</h2>
        <p>
    CSS is a <strong>stylesheet language</strong> used to control the presentation of HTML and XML documents, including SVG and XHTML. 
    It was created in <strong>1994</strong> by the W3C with input from <strong>Bert Bos</strong> and <strong>Håkon Wium Lie</strong>. 
    Its primary objective was to decouple presentation from content, increasing the adaptability and flexibility of web development. 
    <br> While <strong>CSS1 (1996)</strong> introduced the box model and basic text styling, <strong>CSS2 (1998)</strong> 
    brought sophisticated selectors, positioning, and media types. Inconsistencies were rectified in <strong>CSS 2.1 
    (2011)</strong>, and <strong>CSS3</strong> introduced modular features such as animations, transitions, 
    flexbox, grid layouts, and responsive design through media queries. 
    With additional selectors, properties, and functions like variables, container queries, and improved layout
    capabilities, CSS is now a living standard that ensures developers can construct dynamic, responsive, and 
    accessible web designs.<sup><a href="references.html#r13">{13}</a></sup>

        <h2>@-Rules in CSS</h2>
        <p>
          One of CSS’s powerful innovations is the concept of <em>@-rules</em>. These rules 
          CSS at-rules are statements that instruct CSS on how to behave. Each at-rule begins with an
          @ followed by a name.<br>
          Here are some commonly used at-rules:
<ul>
  <li><strong>@import</strong> bring one CSS file into another.</li>
  <li><strong>@media</strong> apply styles depending on device features (screen size, resolution, orientation).</li>
  <li><strong>@font-face</strong> load and use custom fonts in the webpage.</li>
  <li><strong>@keyframes</strong> define steps of CSS animations.</li>
  <li><strong>@supports</strong> check if a browser supports a CSS feature before applying it.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>CSS across different devices</h2>
        <p>
            Making websites that work and look fantastic across a range of screens and devices is essential to
            responsive web design. For this, CSS media queries are an effective tool. It enables you to apply 
            several styles according to particular parameters like screen size, resolution, or orientation. 
            <br>Let us discuss how to use CSS to target particular screen sizes or devices;
        </p>
<ol>

<li><u>Media Queries:</u>
<br>
  Media queries let CSS adapt a website’s layout and style to different 
  screen sizes, orientations, and dimensions.
<ul>
  <li>Apply styles based on screen <strong>width</strong>, <strong>height</strong>, or <strong>orientation</strong>.</li>
  <li><code>@media (max-width: 768px)</code> target tablets and mobiles.</li>
  <li><code>@media (max-height: 500px)</code> target shorter screens.</li>
  <li>Combine conditions with <code>and</code>, e.g. portrait orientation + width limit.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><u>Using Device Pixel Ratio:</u>
<br>
  Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) allows developers to optimize content for 
  high-resolution screens like Retina displays.
<ul>
  <li>Target high-DPI devices using DPR queries.</li>
  <li>Ensure images and text remain sharp on modern displays.</li>
  <li>Common practice: provide higher-resolution graphics for devices with DPR ≥ 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
